# Simulation Modeling and Analysis Project
40.015 Simulation Modelling and Analysis

## Details
**Project Title:** Simulation Modeling of a MRT System using Jaasim

**Description:** Our project is to simulate a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) System Line of Singapore. In our simulation model we used the example of the Downtown (Blue) Line which is connected to our Singapore University of Technology and Design. 

We aim to understand how the average waiting time of a passenger at each station vary according to different train interarrival times. In addition, we want to understand how safe distancing measures in Singapore during COVID times might impact the waiting times. 

This project's objective is to enable insights such as how the Land Transport Authority might be able to modify the current subway service while ensuring satisfactory waiting times.


**Tools used:**
1. **R** to do wrangling of the data and html attributes
2. **JaamSim** java-based free and open source discrete-event simulation
